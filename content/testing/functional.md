Functional Testing
==================

Check if a site function properly.

Two main categories:
--------------------

1.	cross-browser (css/js front-end perfection)
2.	single-browser (raw functioanlity tests)

Tools
-----

1.	Selenium
2.	Node.js based

### Compare

| Selenium | node.js | | -- | -- | | Tests are written in JAVA | Tests are written in nodejs | | Complicated to setup | Much easier to setup | | Tools are finalized | Exacts tools are yet to finalize |

### Node.js based options

**List of tools**

1.	[phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) - just a browser
2.	[theintern.io](http://theintern.io/#compare) - has too many features and still not much talked about. Need to check why?
3.	[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) - from Angular JS team. They have one more
4.	[nightwatchjs](http://nightwatchjs.org/) - another famius tool

**Evaluation criteria** 1. Do we need unit tetsing in nodejs? 2. Do we need cross-browser testing in nodejs? 3. Cookie/session support 4. File upload support 5. AJAX support
